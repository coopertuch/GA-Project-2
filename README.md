<h1>Coop's Cheerups.</h1> 

## Description:
When you need a little positivity in your life, look no further than Cheerups. Coop's Cheerups allows you to read, post, edit, and delete from a board of positive quotes, while tracking positive and negative feedback through likes. 

## Examples:

## Current Features
On load, all Cheerups will be displayed in single rows, or rows of one to three, responsive to your browser. Underneath the logo, there is a "New Cheerup" button which directs users to a new page where they can create their own cheerup; on this page, they will be required to enter the quote and author, with a maximum of 100 and 20 characters for the quote and author, respectively. After submitting a new cheerup, they will be redirected back to the home page. Each cheerup has the option to edit or remove; the edit will direct the user to a new page that has pulled the new cheerup and allows users to edit the quote, author, and update likes. After submitting an edit, they will be redirected back to the home page. The remove button will instantly delete the quote.


## Features in Progress



The next immediate feature in progress will be setting up a Google Sheets API, to simplify and streamline the process of adding and editing questions. Moving forward, there are plans to implement accounts, where users can create a profile and store their own custom questions. Additionally, users can upvote questions to provide positive feedback to aid in generating new questions, while the downvote will remove the question from their account (example shown below). Next, users can 'connect' with other users, combining their pool of custom questions and eliminating any questions each may have removed previously.
