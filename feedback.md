## Technical requirements: Excelling
* Woah I love the likes feature! I'm getting a weird bug where I try to edit a post on my local machine, but it comes up with a blank field, I click on all cheerups and it takes me to your heroku. I deleted a bunch of posts not realizing I was in heroku! However from there I can see full CRUD. Your code checks out too!
